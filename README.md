### Playing back the input melody

Press the button Play to hear the melody.
The volume can be controlled using the slider next to the button. 

### Chords' generation

The new chords are built following Counterpoint rules; for this application, First and Second Species Counterpoint. 
First Counterpoint associates to each note another note of the same duration (1:1 ratio), and these notes must be consonant. 
So, after extracting a sequence of notes belonging to the original chords, First Counterpoint is generated with unisons, perfect 5ths, perfect 8ths, major and minor 3rd, major and minor 6th intervals built up over the former note. 

Second Counterpoint associates to each note two other notes, with half the duration of the original one (2:1 ratio). The note on the stressed beat must be consonant, while the note on the unstressed beat can be dissonant. 
So, the generation of Second Counterpoint notes uses unisons, perfect 5ths, perfect 8ths, major and minor 3rd, major and minor 6th intervals for the first note, while the second note can be also derived from harmonic dissonant chords like major and minor 2nds. 

* Press the button ‘1st Counterpoint version’ to hear the First Species Ctp chords.
